        Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
        came
        around to commiserate. They said, </p>

    <blockquote class="villagers1">"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run
        away. This is most unfortunate."</blockquote>
    <p class="first-p">
        The farmer said, </p>
    <blockquote class="farmer"><strong>"Maybe."</strong></blockquote>
    <p class="first-p"> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
        and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
    <blockquote class="villagers">"Oh, isn't that lucky. What a
        great turn of events. You now have eight
        horses!"</blockquote>
    <p class="first-p"> The farmer again said, </p>
    <blockquote class="farmer"><strong>"Maybe."</strong></blockquote>
    <p>
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
        his
        leg. The neighbors then said, </p>
    <blockquote class="villagers">"Oh dear, that's too <span class="bad">bad</span>,"</blockquote>
    <p>and the farmer responded</p>
    <blockquote class="farmer"><strong>"Maybe."</strong></blockquote>
    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they
        rejected his son because he had a
        broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, </p>
    <blockquote class="villagers">"Isn't that great!"</blockquote>
    <p>Again, he said, </p>
    <blockquote class="farmer"><strong>"Maybe."</strong></blockquote>

    <p>
        The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it's really impossible to
        tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> -
        because
        you never know what will be the consequence of the
        misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
            class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.
        Let's not make a big deal out of it...
